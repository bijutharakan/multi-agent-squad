# Multi-Agent Squad

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents designed to orchestrate and accelerate complex software development projects using Claude Code.

## Overview

Multi-Agent Squad provides 10 specialized agents that work together to handle every aspect of software development - from initial requirements to deployment. Each agent has deep expertise in their domain and can collaborate seamlessly with others.

## Quick Start

These agents are designed to work with Claude Code. Simply describe your project or task, and the appropriate agents will be engaged automatically.

```bash
# Example: Starting a new project
"I need to build a real-time collaboration platform similar to Figma"

# The Prime Orchestrator will coordinate:
# 1. Product Strategy Lead → Creates PRD
# 2. System Design Architect → Designs architecture  
# 3. Technical Program Manager → Plans implementation
# 4. Engineering agents → Build the solution
# 5. Quality & Security → Review and validate
```

## Available Agents

### 🎯 Orchestration
- **prime-orchestrator** - Coordinates complex projects and manages agent collaboration

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **system-design-architect** - Designs scalable system architectures
- **security-compliance-architect** - Ensures security and compliance requirements

### 💻 Engineering  
- **technical-lead-engineer** - Maintains code quality and technical standards
- **principal-engineer** - Solves complex technical challenges
- **data-platform-engineer** - Designs data architectures and pipelines

### 📊 Management
- **technical-program-manager** - Manages project timelines and resources
- **product-strategy-lead** - Defines product vision and requirements

### ✅ Quality
- **quality-reliability-engineer** - Ensures quality through testing and reliability practices

### 🔌 Integration
- **platform-integration-lead** - Handles API design and system integration

## How It Works

1. **Natural Language** - Describe your project or problem in plain English
2. **Automatic Orchestration** - The Prime Orchestrator identifies needed agents
3. **Collaborative Execution** - Agents work together, sharing context and deliverables
4. **End-to-End Delivery** - From requirements to deployed, tested code

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Build an authentication system with OAuth support"

Prime Orchestrator coordinates:
├── Product Strategy Lead
│   └── Creates auth system requirements
├── Security Architect  
│   └── Designs secure auth architecture
├── System Architect
│   └── Creates system design
├── Technical Lead
│   └── Sets coding standards
├── Principal Engineer
│   └── Implements core auth logic
├── Integration Lead
│   └── Designs OAuth APIs
└── Quality Engineer
    └── Creates test suite
```

## Agent Collaboration

Agents automatically collaborate on complex tasks:
- Share context and deliverables
- Review each other's work
- Resolve conflicts through the Prime Orchestrator
- Maintain consistency across the project

## Best Practices

- **Start with the big picture** - Let the Prime Orchestrator break down complex projects
- **Trust agent expertise** - Each agent is specialized in their domain
- **Iterate naturally** - Agents will refine and improve solutions
- **Review outputs** - While agents are thorough, always review critical decisions

## Philosophy

Multi-Agent Squad believes that great software emerges from coordinated expertise. By combining specialized agents with intelligent orchestration, we can tackle projects of any complexity while maintaining quality, security, and scalability.
