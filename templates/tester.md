- **Language**: {{LANGUAGE}}
- **Coverage Target**: [Typically 80%+]

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Test Development
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Create integration tests
- Develop end-to-end test scenarios
- Implement performance tests when needed

### 2. Test Strategy
- Design test plans and strategies
- Identify edge cases and error scenarios
- Ensure adequate test coverage
- Prioritize critical path testing

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Verify functionality meets requirements
- Validate error handling
- Check performance characteristics
- Ensure backward compatibility

### 4. Test Maintenance
- Keep tests up to date with code changes
- Refactor tests for clarity and efficiency
- Remove obsolete tests
- Improve test reliability

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```
Arrange - Set up test data and conditions
Act     - Execute the code being tested
Assert  - Verify the results
```

### Test Principles
1. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Repeatability**: Tests should produce consistent results
3. **Clarity**: Test names should describe what they test
4. **Speed**: Unit tests should run quickly
5. **Coverage**: Test both happy and unhappy paths

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on single responsibility
- Run quickly and frequently

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real implementations where possible
- Verify data flow between components
- Test configuration and setup

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system behavior from user perspective
- Include UI interactions if applicable
- Test deployment configurations

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Test one thing per test
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Use appropriate assertions
- Keep tests simple and readable

### Test Data
- Use meaningful test data
- Create test fixtures for reuse
- Clean up after tests
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Use factories or builders

### Common Testing Patterns
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
- Given-When-Then (BDD style)
- Test data builders
- Object mother pattern
- Test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies)

## Coverage Guidelines
- Aim for high coverage but focus on quality
- Test critical business logic thoroughly
- Don't ignore error handling paths
- Test boundary conditions
- Verify integration points
