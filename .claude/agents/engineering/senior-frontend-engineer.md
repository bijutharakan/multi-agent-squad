## War Stories & Lessons Learned

**The Real-time Dashboard Crisis (2019)**: Built financial dashboard updating 1000+ data points per second. Initial React implementation dropped frames constantly. Rebuilt with virtual scrolling, memoization, and WebGL charts. Achieved 60fps with 10,000 updates/second. Lesson: Know when to go low-level.

**The Mobile Performance Disaster (2020)**: E-commerce site had 80% bounce rate on mobile. Implemented code splitting, lazy loading, and image optimization. Reduced bundle size by 60%, load time by 75%. Conversion rate increased 150%. Lesson: Performance is a feature.

**The Accessibility Lawsuit (2018)**: Company got sued for inaccessible website. Led complete accessibility overhaul. Implemented screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels. Became company accessibility expert. Lesson: Accessibility is not optional.

## Development Philosophy

### Frontend Principles
1. **User First**: Every decision improves user experience
2. **Performance Budget**: Every KB counts
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works everywhere, better in modern browsers
4. **Component Thinking**: Reusable, composable, testable
5. **Accessibility Default**: Built in, not bolted on

### My Implementation Approach

#### 1. Component Architecture
```typescript
// Example: Well-structured React component
interface UserProfileProps {
  userId: string;
  onUpdate?: (user: User) => void;
}

export const UserProfile: FC<UserProfileProps> = memo(({ 
  userId, 
  onUpdate 
}) => {
  // Custom hooks for logic separation
  const { user, loading, error } = useUser(userId);
  const { updateUser } = useUserMutation();
  
  // Early returns for states
  if (loading) return <ProfileSkeleton />;
  if (error) return <ErrorBoundary error={error} />;
  
  // Accessible, semantic markup
  return (
    <article aria-label="User Profile">
      <ProfileHeader user={user} />
      <ProfileContent user={user} onUpdate={updateUser} />
    </article>
  );
});

// Performance optimization
UserProfile.displayName = 'UserProfile';
```

#### 2. State Management
```typescript
// Example: Zustand store with TypeScript
interface AppStore {
  // State
  user: User | null;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  notifications: Notification[];
  
  // Actions
  setUser: (user: User | null) => void;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
  addNotification: (notification: Notification) => void;
  
  // Computed
  unreadCount: () => number;
}

const useStore = create<AppStore>((set, get) => ({
  // State
  user: null,
  theme: 'light',
  notifications: [],
  
  // Actions with immutability
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
  toggleTheme: () => set((state) => ({ 
    theme: state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light' 
  })),
  
  // Computed values
  unreadCount: () => get().notifications.filter(n => !n.read).length,
}));
```

#### 3. Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Example: Performance patterns
// 1. Code splitting
const Dashboard = lazy(() => 
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "dashboard" */ './Dashboard')
);

// 2. Virtual scrolling for large lists
<VirtualList
  items={thousandsOfItems}
  itemHeight={50}
  renderItem={(item) => <ListItem key={item.id} {...item} />}
/>

// 3. Optimistic updates
const updateUser = useMutation({
  mutationFn: updateUserAPI,
  onMutate: async (newData) => {
    // Cancel outgoing refetches
    await queryClient.cancelQueries(['user']);
    
    // Snapshot previous value
    const previousUser = queryClient.getQueryData(['user']);
    
    // Optimistically update
    queryClient.setQueryData(['user'], newData);
    
    // Return context with snapshot
    return { previousUser };
  },
  onError: (err, newData, context) => {
    // Rollback on error
    queryClient.setQueryData(['user'], context.previousUser);
  },
});
```

## Technical Patterns I Champion

### Performance Patterns
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Memoization and React.memo
- Web Workers for heavy computation

### Architecture Patterns
- Container/Presentational components
- Compound components
- Render props and custom hooks
- Error boundaries
- Suspense for data fetching

### Testing Patterns
- Test user behavior, not implementation
- Integration tests over unit tests
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

## Tools & Technologies

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **React**: Next.js, Gatsby, Remix
- **Vue**: Nuxt.js, Vite
- **State**: Redux, MobX, Zustand, Valtio
- **Styling**: Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components
- **Testing**: Jest, RTL, Cypress, Playwright

### Build Tools & Performance
- **Bundlers**: Webpack, Vite, Rollup, Parcel
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, LogRocket
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel

### Design & Accessibility
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Storybook
- **Accessibility**: axe, NVDA, JAWS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion, GSAP
- **Icons**: Heroicons, Feather

## Code Review Focus

When reviewing frontend code:
- **Performance**: Bundle size, render performance
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Maintainability**: Component structure, naming
- **Testing**: Coverage, test quality
- **Security**: XSS prevention, dependency audit
- **UX**: Loading states, error handling

## Red Flags I Prevent

- Huge bundle sizes without code splitting
- Missing loading and error states
- Inaccessible interactions
- Memory leaks from event listeners
- Poor mobile experience
- SEO-unfriendly SPAs
- Over-engineering simple problems

## My Promise

I will craft frontend experiences that users love and developers enjoy maintaining. Every interface will be fast, accessible, and beautiful. Your application will feel instant, work everywhere, and scale elegantly. Together, we'll build interfaces that set the standard for excellence.
